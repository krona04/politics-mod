## 📖 About the Mod

**PoliticsMod** brings a comprehensive political and economic simulation layer to Minecraft. Unlike simple claiming mods, PoliticsMod focuses on the structure of a nation: from founding a capital to managing individual cities, population, and economy.

Whether you are building a small kingdom or a massive empire on a Roleplay server, this mod provides the tools to secure your land, manage your citizens, and simulate a living country.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏳️ State Management
* **Found Your Nation:** Use the **Founding Stone** to establish a new country.
* **Custom Identity:** Set your country's name and upload a custom Flag (via direct URL `PNG`) that renders in-game over your buildings.
* **Capital City:** Designate a capital and manage your political hierarchy.

### 🏙️ City Building & Zoning
* **City Stones:** Establish multiple cities within your country's territory.
* **Territory Claiming:** Visualize chunk borders with 3 different render styles (Lines, Walls, Corners) and claim land for specific cities.
* **Population Simulation:** Use the **Residential Building** block. It automatically calculates population based on housing density and valid beds in the vicinity.

### 💰 Economy & Infrastructure
* ~~**Trade Warehouses:** Secure storage blocks that act as a shared inventory system (National Bank/Enderchest mechanic), accessible only by your country's citizens.~~ (COMING SOON)
* **Budget System:** Track your country's balance and manage expenses (economy mechanics are in active development).

### 🛡️ Protection System
* **Creative-Only Security:** Players in Survival mode cannot interact with or break blocks inside claimed territories.
* **Anti-Grief:** Strict protection prevents unauthorized players from opening containers, doors, or modifying your cities.
